# Introduction
This repo is intended to show the final 2 assignments for our linux class. 

## TLDR;
In the final project, we had to plan a server from scratch, create the server, choose the components, and create the documentation to go along with it.
For my server, I wanted to take a practical approach seeing as this is something I'd like to recreate as something similar to a personal server of my own.
I've decided to include steps taken to enable a Firewall, File Trasnfer Protocol, a LAMP stack setup for future website hosting of my portfolio,
and a PLEX server for my LEGALLY obtained entertainment so unlike streaming platforms, it doesn't get rotated as it stops making the big corporations money.

## Assignment 4 TLDR;
This project was the culmination of what we learned over the previous 10 weeks. We went from the first few assignments with the gui to more of a server application. 
We explore the file system in linux, permissions for files and directories, groupings, and sorting text and piping the sorted lines into a new file.

### Since then:
Since this class ended, In my own time I've explored dual boot on my own workstation, as well as daily driving linux on a laptop. 
Trying many distrobutions of linux including Manjaro, Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint and Mint!OS, I've settled on Fedora 38 and recently followed the upgrade path into Fedora 39.
While employing the use of the GUI, I've found this to be a happy medium between a nice operating system to pick up and use, and being feature rich.

I am also just about finished building a server PC from spare parts that I intend to almost fully execute my final project in this class.
